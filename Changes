Change log for gfsmxl

v0.0.14 Mon, 18 Jul 2016 11:21:53 +0200 moocow
	+ changed void* arithmetic to char* for linking with clang (patch by Florian Petran)

v0.0.13 Wed, 02 Jul 2014 10:20:14 +0200 moocow
	+ fixed memory leak in gfsmxl_cascade_lookup_free() reported by Marcel Bollmann & Florian Petran

v0.0.12 Wed, 26 Mar 2014 16:17:50 +0100 moocow
	+ added awareness for gfsmAlphabet utf8 attribute

v0.0.9 Wed, 10 Dec 2008 11:28:51 +0100
  + added gfsmxl_cascade_nbest_paths(): direct construction of paths
    from backtraces, without intermediate transducer or gfsm_automaton_paths()
    - saves a miniscule amount of time and memory (not worth it really,
      unless someone generates a huge number of shared-prefix paths,
      causing gfsm_automaton_paths() to choke...)
  + fixed shared-path bug in on-the-fly backtrace construction
  + added gfsmxl_cascade_lookup_nbest_paths() to avoid temporary
    automaton construction and read out paths directly, but it's not
    significantly faster than the automaton version (read: here is
    not where we're losing time)...
  + re-added old, slow, bulky, whole-hog automaton construction
    routine as gfsmxl_cascade_lookup_nbest_debug(), used if option
    '--debug' is given to gfsmxl_cascade_nbest_lookup utility.
    - useful for debugging editor cascades, to get an idea of which
      configurations are being investigated

v0.0.8 Sun, 07 Dec 2008 20:35:52 +0100
  + replaced on-the-fly result FST construction in gfsmxl_cascade_lookup_nbest
    with backtrace construction
    - eliminates need for gfsm_automaton_connect() on result FST
    - probably best to add runtime flag for whole-hog construction
    - ca. 14% faster (tested with dta-china.typf.no-mootm.t, dta-rw+tagh.gfsc)

v0.0.7 Tue, 25 Nov 2008 12:00:01 +0100
  + added program gfsmxl_cascade_nbest_lookup
  + fixed NULL-dereference in gfsmxl_arcrange_open_block_index() [gfsmxlLabelIndex.hi]
    causing random-looking segfaults if a NULL pointer (app) was found in abx->q2block

v0.0.6 (development only)

v0.0.5 Tue, 11 Mar 2008 09:51:45 +0100
  + fixed bug in gfsmxl_cascade_lookup_nbest() causing segfaults on duplicate-configs
    - solution: store lists of hash-matching configs as values in cl->configs, steal
      old key before re-insert when dup is found

v0.0.4 Wed, 23 Jan 2008 12:55:54 +0100
  + fixed memory leak in gfsmxl_cascade_lookup_nbest(): new configs weren't being added to hash

v0.0.3 2008-01-07 17:12:17 +0100
  + perl API basically working

v0.0.2 Tue, 08 Jan 2008 13:30:33 +0100
  + various updates for Gfsm::XL perl wrapper
  + added programs: gfsmxl_cascade_compile, gfsmxl_cascade_nth

v0.0.1 Mon, 07 Jan 2008 13:05:47 +0100
  + created
